## What is Ocean Of Positivity
Ocean of Positivity is a simple game designed for young children, to teach them the importance of a positive mindset and to make them aware of the mental health issues that people face. The game is really easy to play and has an interactive and fun interface. 
## Check the game out 
The website is live at: https://zohebmopo.github.io/oceanofpositivity/#
## What it does
The game interface contains various bubbles and animals. The main avatar is the fish who drinks all the bubbles in which `positive words` are written. This leads to an increase in the score.
## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS, and JS. JS brought all the animation and reactivity to the website.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud that we made a game on the web. There are very few games available on the internet which reduce stress and uplifts emotions.  
## What's next for Ocean of Positivity
We are looking forward to making it multi-platform like in android, iOS, and Mac/Windows. Also, we are really looking forward to taking the graphics next level and making it a `3d` game.
